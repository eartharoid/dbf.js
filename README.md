# dbf.js

A simple framework for building Discord bots with discord.js.

## What is this?

dbf.js: Discord Bot Framework for JavaScript.

I made this because my bots shared a lot of code for loading files and handling commands etc.

## Documentation

This early version is not good enough for me to want to write documentation for it. Look at the code in the `src` directory, examples in the `test` directory, and the bots listed above for guidance.
